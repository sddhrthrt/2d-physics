Introduction
============
This is some code I wrote for a college mini-project.
Basic shapes are rectangles and circles (see classes/)
A system is a collection of any number of shapes and
forces acting on them. `System.AddTime(float dt)` method
is used to advance the state of the system by dt seconds.
System.draw is used to draw it.

See main.cc for an example program using the library.

TODO
====
Rewrite in C
